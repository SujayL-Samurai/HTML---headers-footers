            Samurai were the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s during the Meiji era.
            They were the well-paid retainers of the daimyo, the great feudal landholders. They had high prestige and special privileges.
